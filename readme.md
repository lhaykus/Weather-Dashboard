# Weather Dashboard

This application is a weather dashboard used to display the current and future 5-day forecast of a searched city. Using API calls to Open Weather Map, when a user searches a city in the search bar, the weather of that certain city is pulled and then displayed on the page.
The application also saves the searches to local storage to be pulled from and displayed on the page as a search history section. 
Each city weather shows the city name, temperature, humidity, condition and an icon for the user to view.
